//                      WARNING
// While the architecture of the optimizer itself would
// benefit from using Micronaut Inject, we can't do it because
// we perform analysis of the user application classpath and this
// analysis must happen within the same classloaders. It means
// that when we would build the application context of Micronaut
// AOT, we would see customizations from the user environment,
// which we don't want.

    // Most AOT dependencies need to be compile only API
    // because the Micronaut runtime that is going to be
    // used is the one from the application being analyzed
